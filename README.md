Analysis of the 3d volume of brain MRI of the patient is a time taking task for doctors. Deep  Learning algorithms help doctors for investing interesting parts timely and then finalize the  results more efficiently. Brain tumor segmentation separates the cancerous part of the brain  from the normal brain. Brain tumor segmentation is classified into four parts such as  preprocessing, segmentation, optimization, and feature extraction.
